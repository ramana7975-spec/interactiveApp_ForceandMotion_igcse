- **Key Concepts**: Distance, displacement, speed, velocity, and acceleration
- **Equations Covered**: v = u + at, s = ut + ½at², v² = u² + 2as

### 2. Resultant Force
- **Vector Addition Simulator**: Visualize how forces combine using vector diagrams
- **Newton's Laws**: Interactive demonstration of F = ma
- **Visual Representation**: See force vectors, resultant force, and parallelogram of forces
- **Calculations**: Automatically calculates resultant force magnitude, direction, and resulting acceleration
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Modify horizontal and vertical forces, and object mass

### 3. Momentum
- **Collision Simulator**: Watch objects collide and observe momentum conservation
- **Elastic and Inelastic Collisions**: Toggle between collision types
- **Conservation Verification**: Real-time verification of momentum conservation
- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust masses and velocities of both objects
- **Visual Animation**: See the collision process in real-time
- **Key Equation**: p = mv, and conservation of momentum principle

### 4. Terminal Velocity
- **Free Fall Simulator**: Observe an object falling under gravity with air resistance
- **Force Visualization**: See weight and air resistance forces dynamically
- **Terminal Velocity Calculation**: Automatic calculation based on mass and drag
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor current velocity, weight, and air resistance
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Change object mass and drag coefficient
- **Educational**: Demonstrates when air resistance equals weight

### 5. Centre of Mass
- **Balance Point Simulator**: Interactive seesaw demonstrating centre of mass
- **Real-time Calculation**: Shows exact centre of mass position
- **Visual Feedback**: Pivot point moves to show balance
- **Multiple Masses**: Adjust positions and masses of two objects
- **Stability Demonstration**: See how mass distribution affects balance
- **Formula Application**: x_cm = (m₁x₁ + m₂x₂)/(m₁ + m₂)

### 6. Moment (Torque)
- **Lever Simulator**: Interactive lever showing the principle of moments
- **Visual Tilt**: Lever tilts based on net moment
- **Equilibrium Detection**: Automatically detects when clockwise = anticlockwise moments
- **Force and Distance Controls**: Adjust forces and distances on both sides of pivot
- **Moment Calculations**: Real-time calculation of clockwise, anticlockwise, and net moments
- **Key Equation**: Moment = Force × Perpendicular Distance
